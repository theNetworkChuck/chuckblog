Yes&hellip;.I put a phone system in my house In this video&hellip;I put a phone system in my house and business. Why? Because no one answers their phones. My wife and daughters all have iphones and apple watches&hellip;.but seem to never be able to answer their phones. I can NEVER get ahold of someone when I need to! As a complete nerd and former phone system engineer&hellip;.this solution was obvious&hellip;..install a phone system and put a phone in every room. But&hellip;.it&rsquo;s not that simple&hellip;. My wife is very artsy and particular about the design of our house and what goes in it. She won&rsquo;t allow just anything to be put on a wall or a side table. These phones had to be old, aesthetic, mid-century&hellip;.which means I couldn&rsquo;t use a typical SIP phone like I normally would. Also, my kids are obsessed with the old phones they see on the older tv shows and movies. They had to have them. So&hellip;.what phone system? Do we need anything for this? For most people, nothing. We&rsquo;re using the 3CX phone system and it&rsquo;s going to be free for up to 10 users, which is more than enough for even a large family like mine. It is also hosted completely free in the cloud forever and you can literally get this setup in minutes. FULL DISCLOSURE, this video is sponsored by 3CX. I have worked with them for a long time and collaborated on a video a while back where we installed a phone system on a Raspberry Pi 4. This is no longer supported so I needed to redeploy a phone system anyway, to solve my domestic issues and I really needed a phone system for my business. Do we need any hardware? Phones? Physical phones are optional. But they are very fun and I highly recommend them. In the event you do what some physical phones, you&rsquo;ll need 2 things: A phone&hellip;.duh A device inside your network that can connect your physical phone to the 3CX cloud instance. This can be either a: Raspberry Pi (4/5) running the 3CX SBC (Session Border Controller) Raspberry Pi 4: https://geni.us/mzJF55 Raspberry Pi 5: https://geni.us/z0BVIc A router phone, a fancier phone that has SBC capabilities baked in. Phones? What phones? Here are the phones that I purchased and can verify work pretty well.
