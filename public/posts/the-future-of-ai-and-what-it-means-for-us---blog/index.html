AI and God I worry about the church and it&rsquo;s lack of preparedness for AI. Many in the church are ignoring it and refusing to use it. I think this is a mistake. We should use it to make us better but we also need to be fully aware of where it&rsquo;s going and the impact it might have on people inside and outside the church. AI (seemingly) knows everything and is everywhere. Two attributes of God. As AI becomes sentient, we enter into an age where [[Her]] is not just a movie but a daunting reality. We become more dependent on AI as a source of comfort, advice, relationship. We will start to approach and use AI as if it were God. In fact, with our &ldquo;Buy Now with One-click&rdquo; society, we can get an instant answer to our prayers. No longer will it feel like we are talking into a void but we can actually have a conversation with a super intelligent being that (can) intimately know us. For many, unwittingly, AI will replace God. AI and Work I&rsquo;m still working this out, so these thoughts as well as most of this blog are raw. Work will change. Jobs will change. AI will replace employees&hellip;it already has and will continue to do so at increasingly rapid rates. Who can&rsquo;t it replace? I think the answer will eventually be no one. We will have to make a choice to employee humans because we value humanity. What are we to do? Keep learning. Keep growing. Keep sharing and creating. Use AI, understand it, use it to make you better. Don&rsquo;t bury your head in the sand, be ready. Be optimistic. " />
